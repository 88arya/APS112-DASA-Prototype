## **DASA** Concept

The **Dynamic Adjustable Support Actuators (DASA)** system is designed to induce perturbations in the walking cycle by adjusting floor movements to simulate uneven terrain and other perturbations. 
It combines four **ATO-LACTU-1200 motor actuators** for precise control and four **IMA Linear Servo actuators** for high-speed motion. 
The system is housed in two **Aluminum 6061-T6 platforms** and is operator controllable by a **STM32H750VBT6 microcontroller**. 

**Rotational Capabilities**: ±11.4°

**Noise Generation**: <55 dB

**Estimated Cost**: 5654 CAD

## DASA Prototype

The **DASA Prototype** is a 1:5 version of the final system designed to test the functionailty of the concept.
The prototype uses four **Linear Actuator Servo Motors** to simulate floor perturbations by controlling the vertical displacement and rotation of the platform.
A sheet of **plywood** serves as the platform, which is manipulated by the actuators. 
An **Arduino board** controls the servos, while **Python code** manages platform movement, simulating perturbations based on input. 
A **1.1 kg water bottle** will test the system’s response to varying loads.

**Assembly and Programming Duration**: 2 Days

**Final Cost**: 188 CAD
